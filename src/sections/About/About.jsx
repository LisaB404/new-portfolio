          Hi! I’m Lisa Bortoli, a Junior Web Developer based in Italy with a
          passion for coding, books, and animals. I hold a Master in Full Stack
          Development from Start2Impact, where I gained expertise in HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I love transforming ideas into clean,
          interactive, and user-friendly applications.

          With a background in languages, tourism economics, and experience in
          back-office roles, I’ve developed strong organizational,
          problem-solving, and communication skills. I’m detail-oriented,
          prioritize effectively, and always focus on the end-user.

          I bring curiosity, commitment, and a collaborative mindset to every
          project. I’m always looking for exciting challenges and meaningful
          collaborations. Got something in mind? Let’s build it together!
